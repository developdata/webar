# Augmented Reality
This folder has code for A-Frame augmented reality projects. 
A-Frame can be used to develop AR projects, but at the moment only seems to work with Andriod phones and not on all browsers. It should work in Chrome and Samsung mobile browser.

This project was developed from a [project I found on line](https://aframe.io/blog/webxr-ar-module/), you can see their [code on glitch](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/xr-spinosaurus?path=style.css%3A1%3A0)

## dinosaure.html
This file was developed from a [project I found on line](https://aframe.io/blog/webxr-ar-module/), you can see their [code on glitch](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/xr-spinosaurus?path=style.css%3A1%3A0). I made changes so the dinasaur will always appear close to where the person is pointing the camera. In VR mode, if you press the pink box the dinasuar will toggle to appear or disappear. If the camera postion has moved the dinasaur will appear near the new camera position when toggled back on.
